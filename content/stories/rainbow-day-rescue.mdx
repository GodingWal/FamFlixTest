Rain tumbled over the town like coins in a fountain, and the sky put on its darkest coat. Mia and her little brother Theo pressed their noses to the window, counting the drips that raced down the glass. “If we can find the rainbow, we can cheer up the day,” Mia said. Theo nodded and grabbed his red boots. “Let’s rescue it!”

They set off with umbrellas that bloomed like tulips. Puddles clapped under their steps as they searched the wet streets for hidden colors: a blue mailbox, a gold leaf, a pink chalk heart washed soft as cotton candy. At the hilltop, the clouds opened just a little, and a stripe of light peeked through—shy as a smile.

Mia and Theo held their umbrellas high and waved. “We saved you a spot!” they called. The rainbow stretched wider, painting rooftops and treetops and every raindrop in between. Neighbors came outside, cheeks bright, and the day stopped feeling so heavy. “Rescue complete,” Theo declared. And when the last stripe faded, the town kept the colors anyway—tucked in laughter, in muddy boots by the door, and in two umbrellas drying side by side.
