On the night of the Silver Moon, the meadow opened like a secret invitation. Lila packed a picnic: moon-berries, comet crackers, and a bottle of sparkle water that fizzed like giggles. Her grandma tied a ribbon in Lila’s hair and whispered, “Listen for the sky’s soft footsteps.”

They spread a blanket that shimmered faintly, and the first star tiptoed onto it, twinkling hello. Then came another, and another, bringing tiny stories in their light. The stars told of drifting ships and friendly dragons, of wishes saved for rainy days and songs that found their way home.

When the moon climbed high, she peeked over the hill and left a silver kiss on Lila’s cheek. “Thank you for the picnic,” the sky seemed to say, “we’ll bring back your blanket at dawn.” Lila yawned a happy yawn, and Grandma smiled. They packed up the crumbs of magic and walked home slowly, with just enough starlight in their pockets to brighten every dream.
