The forest curled up under a quilt of dusk, and a soft breeze tickled the ferns. Near a hollow log, a little rabbit named Pip brushed pine needles off a tiny mossy doorstep. He had set out acorn cups and berry biscuits for his best friends, and a small lantern glowed like a firefly in a jar. Tonight was Cozy Night—a time to swap gentle stories, sip warm leaf tea, and say thank you to the day.

First came Tulla the turtle, shell polished and bright, carrying a napkin folded like a star. Then Lark the chipmunk skittered in with giggles, his cheeks full of blueberries. Finally, Willow the owl swooped low and landed with a hush, her wings wrapping them all in a feathery hug. “We’re here,” she whispered, “and the forest is listening.”

They nibbled and sipped, and each shared one sweet thing from the day: a shiny pebble, a new trail, a cloud shaped like a kite. When the lantern grew sleepy, Pip tucked a leaf blanket around it and smiled. The friends hummed a lullaby so soft, the fern fronds swayed along. And as stars stitched silver threads across the sky, the Cozy Night folded them in—safe, sleepy, and warm as a nest.
