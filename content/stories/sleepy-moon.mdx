The moon yawned over the quiet town, stretching her silver glow across every sleepy rooftop. Down below, the Rivera family tucked in for the night, each window flickering with warm lamplight. Sofia pressed her nose to the glass and whispered, "Goodnight, Moon," while her little brother Mateo clutched his plush rocket—ready to dream of starry adventures.

But the moon wasn't ready to sleep just yet. She peeked into each room and painted pillow forts with soft light. She sprinkled shimmers over storybooks, giggles, and one brave goldfish who insisted on swimming laps past bedtime. As the family's lullaby drifted upward, the moon hummed along, her glow matching the gentle rhythm of Mama Rivera's song.

When the last note faded, the moon tucked a silvery blanket over the world. Sofia dreamed of floating on moonbeams, Mateo steered his rocket among friendly constellations, and the moon finally rested. She winked one last time, whispered, "Sweet dreams, little stars," and settled into the velvet sky—right where the night needed her most.***
